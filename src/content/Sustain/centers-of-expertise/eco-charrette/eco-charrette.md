## About Eco-Charrette and Conceptual Modeling

Welcome to the Charrettes Webpage! Whether called Eco-Charrettes, Sustainability Charrettes, or Energy Charrettes, the goal is to optimize energy conservation and sustainability while balancing function, operation and maintenance, aesthetics, and cost. Project and site specific sustainability measures are researched, analyzed, and discussed collaboratively with the appropriate project stakeholders.

The Eco-Charrette idea may be applied to the planning, project definition, and design phases of a project. During project planning, the Eco-Charrette effort is focused on identifying the features necessary to meet project goals and determining the associated cost in order to obtain the funding required for implementation.

During design phase, the Eco-Charrette is a critical part of the methodology for providing an integrated design and is focused on optimizing the sustainability of the building project within the funding available.

This webpage has been developed to share information regarding Eco-Charrettes. Content will be updated as information becomes available. Check out the Charrette Samples to see some example Eco-Charrette presentations.
