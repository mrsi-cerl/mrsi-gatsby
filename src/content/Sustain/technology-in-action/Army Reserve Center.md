Location: Fort Shafter, HI
Technology: High Performance Building Envelopes, Lighting & Daylighting, Low Impact Development
POC: Honolulu District

Highlights:
21.5% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
32.2% reduction in water use
70.7% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

The energy-efficient facility is designed to provide administrative, training, classroom, supply and storage support areas to include 188 new parking stalls for the use of its tenants. The design reduced potable water use by 32.2% from a calculated baseline design through the installation of low-flow fixtures including water closets, urinals, lavatories, and kitchen sinks. Potable water consumption for irrigation was reduced by 50.3% through the methods of eliminating permanent irrigation for Site B and using plant materials requiring minimal irrigation need, reducing materials requiring irrigation and using high-efficiency irrigation materials for the site.
