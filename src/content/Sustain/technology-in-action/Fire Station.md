**Location:** Fort Drum, NY

**Highlights:**

- 30.9% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 26.7% reduction in water use
- 91.6% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

In addition to in-floor heating and building envelope insulation, Fire Station II was one of the first facilities to undergo a whole building enhanced commissioning on Fort Drum. Both the Government and the Contractor had to collect and develop new testing criteria and protocols for not only the standard systems such as electrical and HVAC, but for new systems such as the foundation, structural frame and curtain walls. The combination of enhanced physical features; the in-floor radiant heat, increased insulation and the improved air tightness test: coupled with enhance commissioning makes Fire Station II one of the most energy efficient facilities on post.
