**Location:** Fort Irwin, CA

**POC:** Los Angeles District

**Highlights:**

- 30.8% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 48.1% reduction in water use
- 97.9% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

Located in a remote location in the arid Mojave Desert, the long term sustainability of Fort Irwin depends on water conservation, energy independence and waste elimination management. A solar thermal system was located on top of the courtyard canopy to provide 30% of the building’s hot water energy usage. This on-site renewable energy system will provide about 3.44% of the barracks energy needs through this clean energy source. The project team emphasized achieving a very high construction waste diversion (97.86%) which avoided utilizing the limited capacity garrison landfill. The Barracks design also achieved a large reduction in potable water use through the use of low flow plumbing fixtures.
