**Description:**

This project consisted of the design and construction of an Air Field Operations Building (AFOB)
and Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) for the 13th Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) at Fort Carson,
Colorado, providing command, control and management of flight operations, services, and
movement control for the entire BAAF . The single story AFOB houses Airfield Command and
Operations, Airfield Dispatch, Weather Station, Pilot Briefing Area, and Airfield Services, and the
10-story ATCT serves as the primary FAA or International airspace interface that controls all ground
and air movement for the Army Aviation Complex. The project includes an exterior secure storage
building and exterior covered storage area adjacent to the Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) parking
lot and parking apron. Site improvements include landscaping, site utilities and pavement. The
project was designed to achieve NetZero Ready status through the use of co-designed renewable
energy sources and the implementation of sustainable strategies.
