**Location:** Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA

**Date:** FY08

**POC:** Seattle District

- 25.5% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 31.1% reduction in water use
- 96.8% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

The FY08 project represents the first phase of a two-phase plan. The 42,000 sq ft clinic, completed in the spring of 2010, was programmed to house outpatient medical and dental functions: sports medicine, physical therapy, dental clinic, outpatient pharmacy, specimen collection laboratory, and basic diagnostic radiology departments, as well as space for general physical examinations. The main building achieved LEED Gold certification through the use of natural gas-fired condensing boilers, economizer cooling, variable air volume boxes, variable speed drives, CO2 monitoring and control in high density areas, enhanced commissioning, and utility monitoring.
