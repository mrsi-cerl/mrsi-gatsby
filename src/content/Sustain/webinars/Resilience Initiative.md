In 2015, the Corps established its Resilience Initiative. Before its inception (and more so since the initiative was kicked off) resilience has been a topic in the news and used widely to describe everything from pillows ("resilient pillows") to cities bouncing back from disaster or people facing horrible circumstances. The Corps has long provided resilient projects and systems, so what does having a 'resilience initiative' mean to us, and, with all the types of resilience out there, what do we mean by resilience.
