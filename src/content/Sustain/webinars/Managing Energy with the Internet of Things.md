During this webinar, we will discuss how an Internet of Things (IoT) platform can be used to manage Energy consumption in office buildings. IoT sensors monitoring light, heat, and occupancy can be installed throughout a building, and can be powered by, and also control, the building lighting and other systems. By making sure that light, power, and heat are only turned on when and where they are needed, an improvement of 50-75% in energy efficiency can be realized.
