In January 2016, Engineering and Construction Bulleting 2016-3 was released which continues the requirements for using of "Building Information Modeling" and "Civil Information Modeling" (BIM, & CIM, respectively) for our projects. Today we will learn the applicability of this criteria, the details of the requirements, as well as strategies for executing them.

Your Host for this series is Eric Mucklow, AIA. We have two presenters to speak with us for this webinar:
