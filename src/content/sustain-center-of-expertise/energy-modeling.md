## About Energy Modeling

Welcome! The Energy Modeling Center of Expertise in Sustainability (CXS) provides guidance on how to better utilize available energy modeling software to develop energy models in assisting with the design and construction of high performance sustainable and energy efficient buildings. Planners, designers and customers are then better enabled to make informed decisions on incorporating design and sustainability features in projects.

If you have any questions, please contact Energy_Modeling@usace.army.mil.

## Research & Services

The mission of the Energy Modeling CXS is to provide education and guidance on how to better understand energy modeling inputs to develop energy models in assisting with the design and construction of high performance sustainable and energy efficient buildings. Energy modeling is a means to estimate the energy usage of a building by examining the parameters that affect a building's energy consumption and comparing energy saving strategies between a baseline and proposed building. Factors such as building orientation; roof and wall construction; placement of windows; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment; lighting; internal building operations; etc., affect how much energy a building will use. Energy modeling, when performed at the beginning of the design phase, helps the design team identify the respective building components, systems and equipment necessary to achieve the specified energy reduction targets. During construction, any contractor requests for variances or product substitutions that could potentially impact the building's energy usage should be compared against the energy model.

The Energy Modeling CXS provides technical guidance on understanding energy model inputs to help achieve high performance sustainable and energy efficient buildings. By developing accurate energy models to simulate a building's energy usage and understanding the parameters required for the energy model, designers and stakeholders can make informed decisions on design and sustainability features to be incorporated in projects.
