## About Energy Audit

The mission of the Energy Audit Center of Expertise in Sustainability (CXS) is to provide knowledge creation and sharing throughout USACE in the area of Energy Audits to assist the Army and our stakeholders in achieving federally mandated energy and water reduction goals by conducting energy optimization assessments to identify energy and water conservation measures and renewable energy generation opportunities. The audits are a means of identifying cost effective projects and measures to achieve federal energy and water management goals. The most recent of the goals includes 25 percent energy reduction by the end of FY 2025 (2015 baseline) and 36 percent water use reduction by FY 2025 (2007 baseline) as established by Executive Order 13693. Previous goal establishing statutes and Executive Orders include: the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005, E.O. 13514, and E.O. 13423.

Audits assess potential opportunities for: energy and water conservation and renewable energy; modification of operation and maintenance practices/procedures; modification of user behavior; energy-generating, or energy-interfacing system; and recommissioning.

Energy and Water Audit components include:

Audit Planning, Data Gathering, and Pre-Site Visit Evaluation
On-site Site Audit(s)
Evaluation of potential opportunities and Report Development
Development of Capital Investment Strategies (Funding and Execution Planning)
