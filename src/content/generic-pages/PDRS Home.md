## Policy and Guidance

[Army MILCON Code 2 Design Process and Procedures](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/MRSI/content/PDRS/Policy/FY25%20Guidance%20and%20Templates/1_Instructions%20for%20FY25%20Army%20MILCON%20Code%202.pdf) provides guidance, outlines the Code 2 process milestones and instructions for submitting PDR, 3086, and 35% Design Certification deliverables. _Updated to include the ENG 3086 Instructions._

The [ENG 3086 Instructions](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/MRSI/content/PDRS/Policy/FY25%20Guidance%20and%20Templates/Appendix%20F_FY25%20ENG%203086%20Instructions.pdf) have been published. Download them separately or as part of the updated Army MILCON Code 2 Design Process and Procedures document above.

**Very Late Add FY25 Projects**: [Supplemental guidance](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/MRSI/content/PDRS/Policy/FY25%20Guidance%20and%20Templates/Supplemental%20Instructions%20for%20Late%20Add%20FY25s.pdf) and [timeline](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/MRSI/content/PDRS/Policy/FY25%20Guidance%20and%20Templates/Late%20Add%20FY25%20Timeline.pdf) has been published

The [PDR Desktop Reference](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/MRSI/content/PDRS/Policy/FY25%20Guidance%20and%20Templates/FY25%20PDR%20Desktop%20Reference.pdf) is being provided so PDTs have a print of the sections and instructions for completion of the PDR for use outside the PDRS Wizard application. This is to be used as a guide during meetings and to inform the PDT on the information that will be required to complete the PDR in the PDRS Wizard application.

## Previous FY Projects

**Please note: For project(s) prior to FY25**, please go to the classic [PDRS Wizard](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/wizards/pdrsw/Client/WizardApplication.application). In order to log in to the classic PDRS Wizard application, you will still need to use a MRSI Wizard account just as before. If you do not have one and need to request a new MRSI account, please send an email to MRSI Support from the email address you wish to use as your account login (preferably a .mil or .gov address) and we will set one up for you.
