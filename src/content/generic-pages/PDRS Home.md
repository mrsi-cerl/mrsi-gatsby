## About the Army MILCON Code 2 Process

The Army’s Code 2 process is intended to provide the information required to support the programming and budget process in advance of the budget lock for the upcoming Active Army (MCA) and Army Family Housing (AFH) MILCON program. The scope and cost validations completed as part of this process are the last opportunity to ensure that each project has the correct scope and budget estimate, and to put the Army in a posture to ensure successful program execution. The intent of taking the project to 35% Design is to ensure enough engineering design data has been incorporated into the project to develop an accurate scope and cost before the project is included in the Army’s Budget Estimate Submission (BES).

## Policy and Guidance

Instructions for the Army MILCON Code 2 are specific to a project’s Fiscal Year. These instructions provide an outline of the Army’s Code 2 process, required deliverables, and instructions for submitting the PDR, ENG 3086, and 35% Design Certification Deliverables.  The Instructions include Appendices with flowcharts/timelines, Points of Contact, Acronyms & Abbreviations, Example AE Scope of Work Verbiage, a PDR Desktop Reference (explains what’s required for each section of the PDR), the Acquisition Strategy Memo Template, ENG 3086 Instructions, and the DCA Assessment & Risk Neutral Estimate Guidance.
