[Click here to start the new, browser-based PDRS Wizard](https://wizards.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/) **for projects dated FY25 and beyond**.

The Code 2 and Code 3 Design Directives for Army MILCON require the submission and approval of the Parametric Design Report (PDR) and ENG Form 3086 cost estimate. This Parametric Design Report System (PDRS) Wizard is a browser-based tool for the preparation, reporting and submission of the required PDR. The PDR must first be approved before the ENG Form 3086 is submitted. While the ENG3086 status is also tracked in the PDRS Wizard, it is not prepared within this system.

This tool was developed by ERDC-CERL at the request of HQ USACE. If you have questions about the software or the website, please email our support team and we will help you as soon as we are able.

For PDR support, including access to the PDRS Wizard itself and particular projects therein, please contact <a href="mailto:amanda.h.weinert@usace.army.mil">Amanda Weinert</a> or <a href="mailto:rachel.m.phillips@usace.army.mil">Rachel Phillips</a>.

**If this is your first time using the new, browser-based PDRS Wizard:** Once you have signed into the new wizard with your CAC, please contact Amanda or Rachel and ask them to grant you access to the new PDRS Wizard application.

**Please note: For project(s) prior to FY25**, please go to the classic [PDRS Wizard](https://rfpwizard.mrsi.erdc.dren.mil/wizards/pdrsw/Client/WizardApplication.application). In order to log in to the classic PDRS Wizard application, you will still need to use a MRSI Wizard account just as before. If you do not have one and need to request a new MRSI account, please send an email to MRSI Support from the email address you wish to use as your account login (preferably a .mil or .gov address) and we will set one up for you.
