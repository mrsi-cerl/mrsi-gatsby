**About the CRST:**

The CRST is a USACE command-wide, service oriented team reporting to the DCG M&IO through the Chief, Installation Support Division and the Director of Military Programs.

**Mission:**

- Provide specialized, embedded subject matter experts (SME) to select ARSTAF activities to integrate, coordinate, and synchronize initiatives, concepts, strategies, capabilities, and objectives of the Command with those of the ARSTAF activities to which they augment (as a capability extension).

- Identify, define, and validate facility requirements to ensure they meet functional and operational needs, priorities, and objectives that execute Army imperatives, strategies and plans.

- Assure that facility standards and criteria establish a relevant facility and infrastructure baseline across all DOTMLPF domains.

- Provide consultation and mentorship to USACE on the Army’s missions, plans, and senior leader decisions assuring military relevance in executing the USACE Campaign Plan.

**Facts:**

- CRST SMEs provide direct support to meeting three of four Army imperatives (Sustain, Reset, and Transform) that executes Army Strategic Initiative 14.0 (Adjust Global Footprint). CRST SMEs establish and implement the Command framework for executing engineer roles and responsibilities promulgated in Army regulations and directives through direct support to the ARSTAF.
