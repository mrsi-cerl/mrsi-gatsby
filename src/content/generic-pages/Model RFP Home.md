The Model Request for Proposal (RFP) is a set of templates that provides USACE the ability to standardize RFP structure and content for new Military Construction (MILCON) Design-Build (D-B) and Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects.

Model RFP Benefits:

- Provides a consistent format for Request for Proposals.
  Consistency makes it easier for prospective contractors to submit accurate proposals.
- Ensures criteria and Army Standards compliance during design authoring and reviews, contract awards, and delivery of facilities.
  Supports new acquisition strategies, one change in model updates all future RFPs.
- Criteria updates by USACE Centers of Standardization (COS), SRM and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) subject matter experts ensure that new policy and best practices are quickly implemented in the field.

The Model RFP is generated using a web-based application called a Wizard.

The Wizards provide standardization while allowing users define project and facility specific Scopes of Work (SOW).

*Please use Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge to start the Wizard applications. See our FAQ if you are interested in understanding why this is necessary.*
