**Centers of Expertise (CX)** are designated U.S. Army Corps of Engineers organizations (District, Laboratory, or Center) demonstrating capability and expertise in a specialized area. CXs improve capabilities and management, eliminate redundancy, optimize the use of specialized expertise and resources, enhance Corps-wide consistency, facilitate technology transfer, help maintain institutional knowledge in key areas, and improve service to customers, including rapid response to emergencies. 

**A Mandatory Center of Expertise (MCX)** is a USACE organization approved by Headquarters USACE (HQUSACE) as having a unique or exceptional technical capability in a specialized subject area that is critical to other USACE commands.  Mandatory services to be rendered by an MCX are published in an Engineer Regulation and identified on the Technical Excellence Network.  A CX receives its designation as an MCX when one or more services provided by the CX are considered to be mandatory use by all USACE elements.  An MCX may provide additional discretionary or voluntary products or services as authorized, similar to a TCX. However, its designation remains an MCX based on the mandatory component.
