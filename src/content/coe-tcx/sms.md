## About 

SMS-TCX personnel are experts in the field of facility management: the SMS-TCX addresses USACE stakeholder needs by providing innovative solutions to facility assessment, investment identification, and requirements forecasting challenges for DoD installations in all regions of the US and of the world. Some activities around the deployment and use of the Sustainment Management Systems are not an enduring requirement and/or require specialized knowledge not found commonly throughout the Corps.
