**Location:** Fort Wainwright, AK

**POC:** Alaska District

**Highlights:**

- 35.4% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 33.6% reduction in water use
- 78.8% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

This 100,000+ SF, three-story building is comprised of two-bedroom apartments with a full kitchen and dining area. There is a generous recreation area on the second story of the core tower with large south-facing windows that provide a view of the Alaska Range Mountains. In this extremely cold region, the enormous heating demand must be met with a superb building envelope and efficient heating systems. Air-tight construction, triple-pane windows, R-11 doors, R-41 walls and R-62 roof combined with a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) and radiant slab heating system tackle this challenge.
