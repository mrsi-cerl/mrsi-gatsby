**Description:**

Located in a suburban area on the outskirts of Concord, New Hampshireâ€™s state capitol, the command center brings forth a strong military presence to the public as well as creates an iconic structure that now grounds the entire military base. The National Guard chose the project site, in part, due to the fact that both its overall geographic and physical locations, place the facility at a particularly centralized point in the State. It is across the street from the municipal airport and within close proximity to the major roadway networks for the State of New Hampshire and the New England region. It is located on the existing State Military Reservation and is part of the ongoing efforts to consolidate and realign both State and Federal military forces. A newer command structure has replaced multiple antiquated systems in order to reduce manpower and alleviate overlapping functions that previously existed. Both the Army and Air National Guard forces, as well as a civilian support staff occupy the building.
