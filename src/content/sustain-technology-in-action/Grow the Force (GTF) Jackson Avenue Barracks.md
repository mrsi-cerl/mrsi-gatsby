**Description:**

Designed with Joint Base Lewis-McChord’s sustainability goals as a top priority, the UEPH project achieved a high Silver rating without sacrificing quality or comfort. These barracks feature garden style apartments with a kitchenette, washer and dryer unit, full bath, two walk-in closets, and an eating area in each unit. The end results are three facilities which house 300 personnel with a semi-enclosed courtyard and a visitor center intended to perform both as a visitor center and community area as a pool table is included.
