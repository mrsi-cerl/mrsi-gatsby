Black Horse achieved the LEED Gold goal in a variety of means to include; installing a geothermal HVAC system, significantly increasing the insulation and by incorporating the Enhanced Commissioning process during both the design and construction phases. In conjunction with vastly improved insulation which included R-values reaching 60 in the roof, overall air tightness was significantly improved while maintaining excellent air quality. In-floor radiant heating system â€“ supported by the geothermal system, the enhanced commissioning process, and use of local construction materials were some of the key green features that make this one of the finest Child Development Centers in the Army.
