**Location:** Fort Carson, CO

**POC:** Albuquerque District

**Highlights:**

- 47.3% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 48.4% reduction in water use
- 79.0% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

The MI Battalion HQ at Fort Carson demonstrates that LEED Gold is possible for facilities and puts the Army another step closer to realizing its net-zero vision. The MI Battalion HQ installed a 300 kW photovoltaic canopy system that shades half of the parking lot for the facility, while also generating renewable energy for the facility. The photovoltaic system generates enough energy to offset 25.79% of the projectâ€™s energy cost according to LEED, earning the project an Innovation in Design credit for On-Site Renewable Energy. In addition to generating energy, the canopies helped the project earn the Heat Island Effect: Non-Roof credit. The canopies utilize energy efficient LED canopy lights.
