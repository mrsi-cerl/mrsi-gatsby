**Location:** Gainesville, FL

- 41.0% reduction in water use
- 71.8% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

This 25,000 SF Training Building project involved the renovation of a two-story office, 1940â€™s era building that achieved LEED NC Silver Certification. The project received the Restoration & Adaptive Reuse Award from the City of Gainesville Beautification Board in 2009. The facility is configured in a traditional E shape, maximizing the day lighting and cross ventilation potential as was the common practice for the construction time period. The majority of load-bearing walls were maintained in the Training Building. Lights were reused where feasible and relamped. The plumbing is new and includes flow sensor low flow fixtures and faucets. All paints, adhesives and carpet contained low VOCs. The design reduced potable water use by 41% and energy efficiency was increased 15% above the 2004 ASHRAE standards required to meet LEED certification.
