**Location:** Fort Carson, CO

**POC:** Albuquerque District

**Highlights:**

- 119.7% reduction in energy costs (LEED)
- 39.0% reduction in water use
- 89.7% of construction waste diverted from the landfill

**Description:**

To achieve the energy efficiency and sustainability objectives established for BAAF development,
the facility was designed and constructed to minimize electric, heating, and cooling demands.
The design-build team integrated a high concentration of traditional energy efficiency strategies
to achieve extraordinary results that incorporate passive and active renewable energy systems
(focusing on maximizing the use of passive systems), provide an energy efficient building envelope
design, provide Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting and advanced lighting control systems,
incorporate daylighting, connects to a district cooling and heating system, incorporates building
site design and native landscaping to decrease water and energy usage, and select water efficient
plumbing systems. Uniquely, the building envelope includes in-slab radiant heating and a transpired
solar collector to preheat ventilation air. Furthermore, to achieve energy usage goals, the project
includes a photovoltaic panel array providing power generation for this building of approximately
2,130 MWh annually. These integrated strategies result in a Net-Zero facility.
