## Description

The COF Army Standard Design is provided for companies, batteries, and troops as space to perform daily administrative and supply activities. It is also known as a company headquarters building. The COF is comprised of three vertical construction components consisting of an Administrative Module, Readiness Module, and exterior covered hardstand area. In conjunction with this, each site-specific project shall include necessary site amenities, such as vehicle service yards, access drives, and equipment wash stations. This Standard Design applies to Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard Component facilities on Army installations, with the exception of facilities intended for Initial Entry Training, Advanced Individual Training, Operational Readiness Training, or Warrior Transition Units, which are addressed by separate Standard Designs.
