## Description

The Attack Reconnaissance Battalion / Assault Battalion (AAB) Hangar Army Standard Design (SD) defines an entire complex of facilities dedicated to the maintenance, repair, and operation of the aircraft assigned to the individual aviation battalion. The SD defines the functional space and equipment requirements required to maintain the Attack or Assault Battalion aircraft up to the field maintenance level. The SD provides consolidated space within the hangar for all maintenance, flight, and company operations. Therefore, the AAB Hangar does not require space within a separate Company Operations Facility (COF), FCC 14185. Typical functional spaces within the AAB Hangar SD include the aircraft maintenance bay, maintenance administrative and QA/QC areas, parts and tools storage, component repair shops, flight planning and flight operations, and company daily administrative and supply activities. The AAB SD also includes the requirements for POL Storage Building / Hazardous Material Storage Building (21470), Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Storage Shed / Mobile Shop Storage Shed (44222), Aircraft Wash Apron (11370), and Hangar Access Apron (11340). This Standard Design applies to all active Army TOE's and Reserve Component TOE's (when fielded as stand alone, dedicated hangar facilities).

## Variations
