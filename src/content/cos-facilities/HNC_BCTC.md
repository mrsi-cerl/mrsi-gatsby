A BCTC includes primarily classroom space for multipurpose training and instruction typically conducted by an installation Director of Plans & Training using Government and Contractor staff. These facilities may include: classrooms, multi purpose classrooms/work centers, video teleconferencing centers (VTC), after action review facilities (AAR), secure VTC’s, Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) or a Top Secret Working Area (TSWA), Network Operations Center (NOC), Simulations and C4I technical Control Areas, general supply and storage, secure storage, compact item electronic maintenance and repair, break areas, latrines, reconfigurable tactical operations center areas (RTOC), and administrative support space.

This is a general and multipurpose facility intended for use by installation Directors of Plans and Training (DPT) training centers of the Active and Reserve components, and combined arms training center in major training areas. These facilities are distinct from organizational classroom areas (17119) associated with battalion headquarters and trainee barracks. This facility is reported also with unit of measure persons (PN). PN refers to the student capacity of the entire facility, which is defined by Army G3 based on total Army training needs. A Spoke or Hub sized facility is determined at Army and MACOM level, the relative size of the standard facility, small, medium or large is likewise determined by Army G3 and MACOMs.
