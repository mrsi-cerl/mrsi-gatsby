## Description

Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) is a comprehensive, integrated, and immersive
health and fitness system of governance, personnel, equipment/facilities, program,
and leader education that generates lethal Soldiers who are physically ready and
mentally tough to engage with and overmatch the enemy in multi-domain operations.
H2F is an overarching framework (system) that focuses all aspects of human
performance optimization (e.g., periodization, recovery, sleep, injury prevention,
nutrition, mental training) to maximize individual and unit readiness. It is a lifecycle
system that develops/improves/sustains Soldier readiness from pre-accession training,
through an Army career, and as a Soldier for life. One component of this system will
be the Soldier Performance Readiness Center (SPRC). The SPRC is a facility
dedicated for the weekly training designed to generate lethal Soldiers who are
physically fit and mentally tough to engage with and overmatch the enemy in multidomain operations.
