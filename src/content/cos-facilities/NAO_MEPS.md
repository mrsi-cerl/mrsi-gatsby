## Description

Every MEPS represents the state of the art in testing, examining and processing applicants for enlistment into the Armed Forces. Each provides "red-carpet" service to every applicant with personalized, efficient and professional attention.

Featuring modern facilities and equipment, today's modern MEPS bears little resemblance to the traditional image of the drab "Induction Station" known by previous generations of American soldiers, Marines, Sailors, airmen and Coast Guardsmen.

Additional Information: IBC Occupancy Classification B Occupancy. The facility includes administrative offices, aptitude testing, medical testing, military liaison and assembly areas. Operation and construction is similar to a civilian office building with small medical, educational and administrative space. While there are few MILCON projects for MEPS, Norfolk District manages SRM for MEPCOM including furniture, signage and graphics.
