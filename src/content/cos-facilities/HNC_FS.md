## Description

FS facilities are comprehensive facilities designed to support the military firefighter’s mission to protect lives, installation facilities and flightlines. The facility also accommodates the firefighters’ administrative functions and provides an environment for fire prevention education and training. The varying components for this facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.
