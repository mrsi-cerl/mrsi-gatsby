## Description

Army Standard Designs (SD) for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) define a complex of facilities dedicated to operating, maintaining and housing two (2) UAS groups for the assigned Army Combat Aviation Brigade. These groups are classified as Group 3 which are for aircraft that operate at medium altitudes with medium to long range endurance and Group 4 which are for larger aircraft that operate at medium to high altitudes and have an extended range of endurance.

Each SD defines the functional space and equipment requirements required to maintain each UAS aircraft group up to unit level maintenance. Each UAS hangar is to be complete with parts and tool storage space, company headquarters, administrative flight operations and maintenance spaces for the assigned aircraft. The Group 3 hangar is available for up to three assigned platoons whereas the Group 4 hangar is available for a single assigned company. Miscellaneous support vehicles and trailers will be stored and maintained at a separate adjacent Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility (TEMF) or Motor Pool.

## Variations
