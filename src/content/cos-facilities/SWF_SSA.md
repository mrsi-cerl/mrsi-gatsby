## Description

The SSA is a major deployment and sustainment operations facility with functional, operational and spatial relationships critical to meeting unit deployed supply storage at a brigade/separate battalion level. The structural elements of a SSA are similar in purpose to a Central Issue Facility or General Purpose Warehouse. The functional and operational characteristics of a SSA require that the design be based on the type of material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility and the operational readiness. Typical SSA for the personnel supplies at a brigade level should have a built up area of 20,640 square feet. The minimum stack height of storage units required is 16 feet. Adequate space for fork-lift movement within the storage area should be provided and a charging station for fork lift trucks is required. SSA facilities will include administrative spaces, contractor logistics support area, a multi-purpose conference room and Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) compliant men's and women's toilets. Typical occupancy is 11 or more personnel and adequate parking shall be provided. The building shall be ABA compliant. Fire alarm and signal systems shall be provided.
