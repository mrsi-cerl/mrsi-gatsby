## Description

The TEMF Army Standard Design defines an entire complex of facilities for the maintenance, repair, deployment, mission planning/rehearsal, training, and sustainment of equipment assigned to a unit other than aircraft. It defines space and equipment to maintain vehicles and associated equipment for all levels of maintenance below depot level for TOE/TDA equipment. Typical operations within the primary vehicle maintenance shop (VMS) within the TEMF complex include inspection, lubrication, preventive maintenance, diagnostic analysis, welding, body work, replacement of direct exchange systems, mobile maintenance team support, replacement of major components, repair of emission control system, performance of body and frame repair, and administration and scheduling of vehicle use and maintenance. The TEMF Standard Design is also applicable for other 214-, 218-, and 219-series facilities as further defined within the document; and it includes requirements for Organizational Storage Building / Distribution Company Storage Building / Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Storage Building (21412), POL Storage Building / Hazardous Waste Storage Building (21470), Distribution Company Secure Open Storage (45210), and Organizational Vehicle Parking (85210). This Standard Design applies to Active and Reserve Component TEMFs (when fielded as stand alone, dedicated facilities) on Army installations, with the exception of facilities intended for Operational Readiness Training, which is addressed by a separate Standard Design.
