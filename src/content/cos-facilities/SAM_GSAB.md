## Description

The General Support Aviation Battalion (GSAB) Hangar Standard Design (SD) defines an entire complex of facilities dedicated to the maintenance, repair, and operation of the aircraft assigned to the individual aviation battalion. The SD defines the functional space and equipment requirements required to maintain the GSAB aircraft up to the field maintenance level. The SD provides consolidated space within the hangar for all maintenance, flight, air ambulance, and company operations. Therefore, the GSAB Hangar does not require space within a separate Company Operations Facility (COF), FCC 14185. Typical functional spaces within the GSAB Hangar SD include the maintenance bay, maintenance administrative and QA/QC areas, parts and tools storage, component repair shops, flight planning and flight operations, air ambulance operations, and company daily administrative and supply activities. The GSAB SD also includes the requirements for POL Storage Building / Hazardous Material Storage Building (21470), Ground Support Equipment
(GSE) Storage Shed / Mobile Shop Storage Shed (44222), Aircraft Wash Apron (11370), and Hangar Access Apron (11340). This Standard Design Applies to all active Army TOE's and Reserve Component TOE's (when fielded as stand alone, dedicated hangar facilities).
