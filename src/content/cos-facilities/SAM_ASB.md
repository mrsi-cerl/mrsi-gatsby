## Description

The Aviation Support Battalion (ASB) Hangar Army Standard Design (SD) defines an entire complex of facilities dedicated to the maintenance and repair of all aircraft assigned to a Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB). The SD defines the functional space and equipment requirements required to maintain CAB aircraft up to the sustainment maintenance level. The SD provides space for the Aviation Support Company along with select elements of the Headquarters Company and Supply Company. The ASB Hangar SD does not provide Company Operations spaces within the hangar and therefore will require the support of a separate Company Operations Facility (COF), FCC 14185. Typical functional spaces within the ASB Hangar SD include the aircraft maintenance bay, maintenance administrative and QC/QA areas, parts and tools storage, and component repair shops. The ASB Hangar SD also includes requirements for POL Storage Building / Hazardous Material Storage Building (21470), Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Storage Shed / Mobile Shop Storage Shed (44222), Aircraft Wash Apron (11370), and Hangar Access Apron (11340). This Standard Design applies to all active Army and Reserve Component ASB Hangars (when fielded as stand alone, dedicated hangar facilities).
