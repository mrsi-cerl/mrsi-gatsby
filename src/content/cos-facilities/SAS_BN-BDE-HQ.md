## Description

The BDE & BN HQ Army Standard Design defines functional/operational requirements for brigade and battalion level headquarters buildings that house the command, personnel, intelligence, operations, supply, communications, and other specialized functions of a regiment/group/brigade and/or a battalion/squadron headquarters, to include all headquarters administrative and command & control operations. Battalion classrooms are included as part of the BN HQ, but shall be accounted for separately under CATCD 17119, Organizational Classrooms. This Standard Design applies to Active, Reserve, and National Guard Component facilities on Army installations, with the exception of facilities intended for Initial Entry Training, Advanced Individual Training, Operational Readiness Training, or Warrior Transition Units, which are addressed by separate Standard Designs.
