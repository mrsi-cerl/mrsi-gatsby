## Description

The Medium TOE Rotary Wing Aviation Battalion Aircraft Maintenance Hangar Standard Design (SD) defines an entire complex of facilities dedicated to the maintenance, repair, and operation of the aircraft assigned to the individual aviation battalion. The SD defines the facility functional and equipment requirements for an Assault or GSAB Battalion maintenance, flight and company operations. The accommodated Battalion company operations personnel do not require space within a separate Company Operations Facility (COF), FCC 14185. Typical functional spaces within this Hangar SD include the maintenance bay, maintenance administrative and QA/QC areas, parts and tools storage, component repair shops, flight planning and flight operations, air ambulance operations, and company daily administrative and supply activities. The SD also accommodates POL Storage / Hazardous Material Storage (21470), Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Storage (44222), Aircraft Wash Apron (11370), and Hangar Access Apron (11340). This Standard Design Applies to all active Army TOE and Reserve Component TOE units (when fielded as stand alone, dedicated hangar facilities).

_Previous Rotary Wing Standard Designs are not valid for projects programmed for FY25 and beyond, whether new, repair or renovation._

For hangars supporting other than Assault or GSAB TOE units, contact COS for applicable Standard Designs, if available.
