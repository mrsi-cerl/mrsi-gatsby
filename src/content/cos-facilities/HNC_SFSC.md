## Description

The SFSC will be a hub or all encompassed “Campus” includes the essentials of 5 main buildings: Military Personnel Department (MPD), Army Community Service Building (ACS), Reception Barracks Building (RBB), Solider Readiness Processing Center (SRPC), and Family Readiness Center (FRC). These buildings will service and employ full time staff, part time staff and volunteers. The SFSC campus must include area for child care services, military in-out processing, youth activity related functions, area to perform basic medical and dental care, military housing, financial and legal consultation, area in which to inquiry and obtain leisure travel, recreation and theme park tickets, location for fast food eatery and lodging for government and military.
The SFSC features a UEPH module housing component with common area space for command & control for temporary lodging until Soldiers are fully processed and assigned into their units. Housing is included in the SFSC for consideration as part of the site selection process for the notional campus, it is not intended to add installation requirements or be a replacement for permanent or training barracks. The Floor Plan Tabulations identify the specific use (i.e. lobby, director’s office, classroom, etc.) and the SF associated with each program element in the SFSC campus. Allowances for circulation and mechanical rooms are noted separately in the tabulations. The floor plans are considered notional; the actual percentage of space needed for common areas will change with further architectural and engineering design study. For purposes of the Area Development Plan (ADP) and installation specific
Area Development Guide (ADG) the total GSF represented for the SFSC building footprints (ACS, FRC, MPD, SRP and reception barracks) should be considered approximate. This Facility is primarily an administrative building. It will accommodate the Army required functions for processing that include Military Personnel, In-Out Processing, Housing, Finance, ACAP Army Career Program, Transition Branch, Retirement Services (RC Career Counselor), Reassignments Branch, Customer Services, Casualty and Education Counselor.
The varying components for this facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.

For SFAC facility (Soldier Family Assistance Center) refer to Warrior in Transition Complex.
