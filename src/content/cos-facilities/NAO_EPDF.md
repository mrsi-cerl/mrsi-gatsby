## Description

A facility, with cafeteria style dining operations, for unaccompanied personnel and other authorized persons.

## Variations

**Permanent Party Dining Facility**- 72210

The Small (formally 500 Person) Permanent Party (PP), Medium (formally 800 Person) Permanent Party, and Large (formally 1300 Person) Permanent Party Dining Facilities (DFAC) Army Standards and Standard Design define functional/operational requirements for permanent party dining facilities. There are three sizes, Small is 400-660 person, Medium is 661-1056 person and Large is 1057-1716 person, which represent the patrons served in a single meal. In general these facilities are set up similar to a college cafeteria/food court style serving where larger varieties of food are prepared. PP DFACs are not necessarily programmed with housing or training facilities. Training and Operational Readiness Training Complex Dining Facility (72212) standards are not the same as PP DFACs.

See Army Standard below. EPDF Army Standard 20120215 applies to FY14 and beyond projects. EPDF Army Standard 20090717 applies to FY10 through FY13.

**Trainee Dining Facility**- 72210

The 1300 Person Training Dining Facility (TNG) and 2600 Person TNG Army Standard and Standard Designs define functional/operational requirements for trainee dining facilities. There are two sizes for Training, 1300 and 2600 person, which represent the patrons served in a single meal. In general these facilities are for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training (BT/AIT) Complexes and other structured trainee environments. Meals are cooked on site and serving is linear in nature with the tray return set up to accommodate large groups of patrons leaving simultaneously. It also provides an exterior assembly canopy outside each entrance. TNG DFACs are generally programmed with Training Complexes. Permanent Party (72210) and Operational Readiness Training Complex Dining Facility (72212) standards are not the same as TNG DFACs.

**Operational Readiness Training Complex Dining Facility**- 72212

The 720 Person and 1428 Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC) Dining Facility Army Standards and Standard Designs define functional/operational requirements ORTC dining facilities. There are two sizes, 720 person and 1428 person, which represent the patrons served in a single meal. Meals are cooked on site and serving is linear in nature with the tray return set up to accommodate large groups of patrons leaving simultaneously. It also provides a small exterior assembly canopy outside each entrance. The facility is considered “austere” in relationship to Permanent Party and Training DFACs. ORTC DFACs are generally programmed with ORTC Complexes (72212). Permanent Party and Training Dining Facility standards are not the same as ORTC DFACs.

ORTC Complex Dining Facility standards can be found with the Louisville District standard for the ORTC Complex.
