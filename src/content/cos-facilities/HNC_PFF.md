There are mandatory modules that must be provided in the PFF. However, within the areas above, a Structured Activity Module is provided which provides installations the ability to select functions to support their programs.

In addition, a Natatorium may be programmed to be built as part of the PFF. The three most common sizes of Natatoriums are 12,869 square feet for a 25 yard, 8 lane pool; 16,560 square feet a 25 meter by 25 yard pool; and 28,890 square feet for a 50 meter by 25 yard pool.
