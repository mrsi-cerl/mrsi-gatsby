## Space Information

Available exterior envelopes:

### 1. Common Uniform Building Envelope (CUBE)

<img src="/admin/images/uploads/cube-render.png" alt="CUBE Render" width="80%" />
<img src="/admin/images/uploads/cube-envelope.jpg" alt="CUBE Envelope" width="80%" />

The CUBE consists of panelized wood panels, the dimensions are 7.3M x 4.9M (35.77m<sup>2</sup>), which is the size of a single modular "Bay". The structure, including the foundation is built entirely out of wood, and can be constructed with skilled labor in approximately 40 hours. This is a temporary facility with a design life of 5 years: its design life can be extended up to 25 years with exterior finishes.

<img src="/admin/images/uploads/safe-envelope.jpg" alt="SAFE Envelope" width="80%" />

The SAFE a semi-permanent concrete frame structure with CMU infill, the dimensions are 12.9m x34.3m (885m<sup>2</sup>). The design is two-story construction and can be either be lengthened or shortened by the standard bay length. Its design includes an integral protective roof. This is a great choice for Billeting, Administrative spaces, Operations, and Life Support Facilities.

### 3. Standard Adaptive Facility Envelope (SAFE1)

<img src="/admin/images/uploads/safe-1.png" alt="SAFE1 Render" width="80%" />
<img src="/admin/images/uploads/safe-envelope.jpg" alt="SAFE1 Envelope" width="80%" />

The SAFE1 is a single-story version of the SAFE, the dimensions are 12.9m x34.3m (442.5m<sup>2</sup>). This is another great choice for Billeting, Administrative spaces, Operations, Dining, and MWR.

### 4. Tactical Earthen Rapidly Raised Assembly Hut (TERRA HUT)  Option 1

<img src="/admin/images/uploads/terra-hut-render.png" alt="Terra Hut Option 1 Render" width="80%" />
<img src="/admin/images/uploads/terra-hut-envelope.jpg" alt="Terra Hut Option 1 Envelope" width="80%" />

The TERRA HUT option 1 is a Compressed Earth Block Structure modular structure, the dimensions are 8m x 14.7m (118.3m<sup>2</sup>). The Envelope is designed for single-story construction and can be either be lengthened or shortened by the standard bay length. A protective roof is available. The envelope is constructed with on-site soils 10%-20% clay, 65%-80% sand, 10%-20% silt and 7% cement. Block making equipment is needed (contact CoS for equipment information). Blocks must cure for 7 days prior to use. This is an excellent choice for locations with limited materials. This envelope provides the most cost-effective, non-combustible facility.

The Envelope is constructed of metal and is designed to be lengthened or shortened by bay lengths. This is a great choice for Storage, Maintenance, or the Fire Station and Supporting Facilities.

### 8. CUBE Tower

<img src="/admin/images/uploads/cube-tower.png" alt="CUBE Tower Render" width="80%" />
<img src="/admin/images/uploads/cube-tower-floorplan.jpg" alt="CUBE Tower Envelope" width="60%" />
