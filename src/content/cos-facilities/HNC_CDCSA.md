## Description

A CDCSA is used by the Army to support readiness of families by reducing the conflict between military mission workforce requirements and parental responsibilities. CDCSA facilities covered in this standard were developed to support the needs of children 6 - 10 years of age. A CDCSA provides before-school and after-school care during the duty day, summer, school-out days, and holidays. Services are generally provided on a regularly scheduled daily basis for before-school and after-school care, as well as on a full-day basis during the summer, school-out days, and holidays. The Army Standards for CDCSA are based on Army Baseline Standards and Department of Defense requirements for certification.
