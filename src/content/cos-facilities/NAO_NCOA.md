## Description

The Non-Commissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) is part of the Non-Commissioned Officer Education System (NCOES) which provides an Academy environment for educating Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) in the United States Army. The Non-Commissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) is comprised of a dedicated campus of buildings for conducting individual and collective training for Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs). The Non-Commissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) is required by the Army to accommodate administration, instruction, living, dining, outdoor training, equipment storage, related site amenities, and parking. The NCOA is comprised of several facility types to meet the Army's needs; the Academy Building which houses the Administration and core instruction functions, AST Barracks, Dining Facility (medium and large NCOA), Covered training, and Lawn Equipment Storage Building (LEB).
