## Description

DES facilities are designed to support the military firefighter’s and security's mission to protect lives, installation facilities and flightlines. The facility also accommodates the firefighters’, safety officers', and provost officers' administrative functions and provides an environment for fire prevention, safety and security education and training. The Army standard is currently under development for DES.
The varying components for this facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.

## Variations

These facilities are tailored to meet the requirements of the installation based on the services that are needed.
