## Description

The Army Standard for Access Control Points (ACPs) was approved by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) on 13 April 2012. The USACE Omaha District is the Center of Standardization (CoS) for ACPs and is the primary developer of the Army Standard for ACPs. The COS for ACPs worked with OACSIM and OPMG to ensure that the Standard accurately reflects the requirements of HQDA. The waiver process for Army Standards is identified in AR 420-1.
The Army Standard is effective for Military Construction design and mandatory, where possible within statutory limitations, for major renovation projects in FY2013 and beyond. For COS purposes 'major renovations' have been interpreted as those projects causing a change to the footprint of the ACP (e.g. change in number of lanes, location of active vehicle barriers or ID check, etc.). For those projects using prior years funds (those which do not meet the aforementioned triggers for the 2012 version of the Army Standard) the version of the Army Standard in effect will be utilized. Links to those previous versions can be found below.
The aforementioned 13 April 2012 Army Standard for Access Control Points will be used in combination with the October 2018 version of the Army Access Control Points (ACPs) Standard Design. The October 2018 version replaces the May 2013 version.
Any questions related to the Army Standard for ACPs or the Army ACP Standard Design/Criteria for ACPs should be directed to the Omaha COS points of contact shown on this page. The 2012 Army Standard and the 2018 Army Access Control Points Standard Design can be downloaded from the Category folder below:
