## Description

Youth Centers (YC) are designed primarily for use by middle school youth (ages 11-15) and teens (ages 16-18). These facilities provide safe, supervised, healthy, accountable and age-appropriate activities for youth and teens. The YC supports opportunities for youth and teens to develop their physical, educational, social, recreational, and emotional needs. The Army Standards for YC are based on Army Baseline Standards and Department of Defense requirements for certification.
