This webinar will provide the student with an understanding of electrochromic dynamic glass, and how it can be used as a design enabler. Studies have confirmed that the sun's daylight and a connection of the outdoors provide many benefits to human health and natural body function. It is important for all stakeholders in the built environment to understand how to effectively utilize the sun for interior daylighting, while preserving the view of nature and place. Dynamic glass is a solution to that synthesizes the competing ends of daylighting and views, energy efficiency, and occupant comfort.

Our presenter, Christopher L. Allen, is the Territory Manager for SageGlass, a manufacturer of dynamic glass products. He is a former U.S. Army officer who studied City and Regional Planning at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology, where I developed an interest in sustainable urban trends. Through Saint-Gobain recruitment I discovered SageGlass, which is the world's leading supplier of electrochromic dynamic glass. This company aims to create sustainable habitats for all people in the 21st century and beyond, and is gaining traction as the next frontier of glazing solutions.
