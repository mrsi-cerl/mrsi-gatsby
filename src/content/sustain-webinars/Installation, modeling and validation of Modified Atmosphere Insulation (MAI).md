Learn about the use of Modified Atmosphere Insulation (MAI), a type of Vacuum Insulated Panel (VIP)

Speaker: Tapan Patel, Research Mechanical Engineer, CERL

Host: Eric Mucklow, HQ USACE

Series Coordinator: Kelli Polzin, HQ USACE

This webinar will discuss the use of Modified Atmosphere Insulation (MAI), a type of Vacuum Insulated Panel (VIP), in DoD facilities. The MAI has been installed in a facility at Ft. Drum, NY. The goal is to demonstrate the procedure for installing MAI, and validate its performance through modeling and validation. This webinar will focus on the case study and will include the following topics:

1. Installation Procedures

2. Performance data of MAI panels

3. EnergyPlus modeling of MAI panels

4. Validation of energy models using sensor data

By participating, you can learn how to:

1. Describe expected impacts to energy consumption within facilities

2. Describe modeling considerations when using EnergyPlus to simulate MAI performance in facilities

3. Define a procedure for validating MAI energy models using sensor data from a facility

Our presenter, Mr. Tapan Patel, is a mechanical engineer within the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL). He is involved in facilities research including building envelopes, HVAC systems and energy modeling. He is leading several projects that aim to develop and validate the cost effectiveness of emerging envelope and HVAC technologies.
