Engineering and Construction Bulletin (ECB) 2015-7 describes the minimum requirements for performing Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) for energy conservation alternatives during the design phase for buildings, renewable energy systems, central energy plants and heating or cooling distribution networks. As stated in the Sustainability Design and Development (SDD) Policy “The Army will plan, design, build, and operate facilities to achieve the highest-performing sustainable design that is life-cycle cost-effective within the program amount.” Compliance with this ECB will ensure LCCA activities for energy conservation alternatives are being performed and documented in accordance with the referenced requirements. These LCCA requirements are significant design activities that must be performed for a building design to achieve high performance and sustainable facilities that comply with legislative mandates referenced by Unified Facilities Criteria 1-200-02
