During this webinar, we will discuss how an Internet of Things (IoT) platform can be used to manage Energy consumption in office buildings. IoT sensors monitoring light, heat, and occupancy can be installed throughout a building, and can be powered by, and also control, the building lighting and other systems. By making sure that light, power, and heat are only turned on when and where they are needed, an improvement of 50-75% in energy efficiency can be realized.

Our presenter, Tanuj Mohan, started Enlighted Inc.in 2009 and has grown it to over 100 employees with real revenues. Heâ€™s applied 20+ years of computer networking, software and security knowledge, with a large dose of common sense, to build a company from scratch into a world leader in advanced lighting control.

He has worn many hats - Engineering leader, Technology nerd, Creative Marketer, Technical Salesman and expert cappucino maker.
