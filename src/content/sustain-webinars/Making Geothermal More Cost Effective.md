This presentation focuses on practical ways in which geothermal systems can be designed for low life cycle cost. This includes an overview of what makes an efficient geothermal system, examples of how to reduce the installation cost of a geothermal system, how to design for low maintenance, and how to accurately account for the life cycle cost savings of ground source heat pump systems. While designers can benefit from tips on improving designs, the high level overview of what goes into a good GSHP design process can help anyone involved in the facility construction process better understand how to structure projects, identify opportunities, and request design services that will make their GSHP projects more successful.
