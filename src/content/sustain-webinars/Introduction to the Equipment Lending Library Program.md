Introduction to the Equipment Lending Library Program - How Army DPWs/Installations can get access to specialized equipment and technical training to perform energy audits and similar diagnostic functions.

Speaker: Dr. Matthew Swanson, Research Engineer, CERL

Host: Eric Mucklow, HQ USACE

This webinar will serve as an introduction to the new Equipment Lending Library pilot program. The goal of this program is primarily to provide energy auditing and commissioning equipment. Additionally, the program serves to provide training to installation personnel. The presentation will cover the equipment that is currently available, the recently-developed video-based training videos, the equipment loaning process, and future goals for the program.

By participating, you can expect to:

- Understand the function of the Equipment Lending Library program

- Be able to navigate to the online resources for training material and contact information

- Understand the responsibilities assumed while using equipment from the program

Our presenter, Dr. Matthew Swanson, works as a research engineer in the energy branch of the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. During the past 6 years with the laboratory, his efforts have been focused on developing the NZP tool and using the tool to assist with sustainability plans for installations. His work also focuses on supporting energy auditing and recommissioning efforts on installations.

Although these webinars are not restricted, they do not represent official positions or endorsement by USACE or the Army.
