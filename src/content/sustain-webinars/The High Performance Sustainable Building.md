Abstract: ECB 2017-1 High Performance Sustainable Building (HPSB) Checklist Beta Testing was released on January 24, 2017 directing all districts to volunteer at least one project and point of contact to "Beta Test" a replacement for the current spread-sheet based Energy & Sustainability Record Card that had been in use since 2013. The new HPSB Checklist is be able to be integrated into the Sustainment Management Systems (SMS) databases mandated for Tri-Service use by DoD. It also incorporates significant changes to the Federal "Guiding Principles" and UFC 1-200-02 which govern the sustainability and energy requirements for ALL military facilities.

1. Gain an understanding of the significant change in the way compliance with the HPSB requirements will be validated and tracked.

2. Have an overview of the content of the new HPSB Guiding Principles Checklist, its origin, and how it is structured.

3. Understand the Beta Testing process of Beta Testers

4. Learn the requirements for participation and expectations.

At the Headquarters of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Eric Mucklow is the program manager Building Technology, Standards & Criteria, as well as the Architectural Community of Practice Lead. In this role, he seeks new or underutilized and innovative design solutions; especially incorporating viable new technologies or construction techniques for enhanced energy performance and sustainability. His goal is to provide leadership that guides others who are tasked with completing major construction contract documents and resolving a wide-range of technically complex, challenging and politically sensitive issues over a diverse range of project types.
